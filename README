Training data, `True.zip` and `Fake.zip`, must each be unzipped into the root folder.

Usage is simple: if there are no .p files from previous times the program is 
run, then run

python preprocess.py
python bayes_train.py
python bayes_test.py

If train.p, test.p, and vocab.p are present, then it is not necessary to run
preprocess.py. If loglikelihood.py and logprior.py are also present, then
bayes_train.py does not need to be run either.
