# Cameron Cunningham's Portfolio
Thank you for visiting my portfolio, a sample of the work I've done while studying for my Bachelors of Science at the University of Oregon. For more information about me, as well as my contact information, my resume can be found in the root folder (`cameron-cunningham-resume.pdf` and `cameron-cunningham-resume.docx`). 

I realize that it is currently a little bit sparse; stay posted, there's more coming!

## Projects
For more information on each project, please read its respective README file.

* [DuckWeb Schedule Adder](./duckweb_schedule_adder), written in Python, is a personal project I created as a student to automatically add my course schedule to Google Calendar. It was a great opportunity to learn about and practice web scraping and API calls, two things I'd previously known nothing about. 
* [Fake News Classifier](./fake_news_classifier) is a Bayes classifier, my final project from my natural language processing (NLP) class. It classifies news articles as being 'fake' or 'real', though it should be noted that real-world fake news has likely evolved in the years since I created this project.
