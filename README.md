# Cameron Cunningham's Portfolio

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, a sample of the work I've done while studying for my Bachelors of Science at the University of Oregon. For more information about me, as well as my contact information, my resume can be found in the root folder (`cameron-cunningham-resume.pdf`).

* Fake News Classifier is a Bayes classifier, my final project from my natural language processing (NLP) class. It classifies news articles as being 'fake' or 'real', though it should be noted that real-world fake news has likely evolved in the years since I created this project.
